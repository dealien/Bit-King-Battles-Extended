# About
-------

Bit King Battles Extended is a modified version of Bit King Battles created by VyrenGames (http://www.twitch.tv/vyrengames).
Original Bit King Battles created by Ocgineer (http://www.twitch.tv/ocgineer).

Bit King Battles is a "Bit Boss Battle" and "Stream Minions" clone made for AnkhBot
Python scripts. The main concept around these type of minigames comes down that a
current king has to be defeated by other players using cheers aka bits. When the
current king is defeated the person that dealth the killing blow will become the
new king to be defeated by others. Depending on the selected mode AND the amount of
bits used to defeat the king, the health, maximum health and shield values will
differ. Main advantages over online services;

  - 13 different customizable Twitch Chat Message outputs on different possible events
  - Python Script can be adjusted to your own needs and specifications
  - Overlay can be adjusted or rewritten from scratch to your own needs and specifications
  - Different overlay styles can be easely used in conjunction with each other, having the same data

# Bit King Battles Modes
------------------------

This python script contains different modes you can select to determain
the new kings vitals.

  - Shield Mode

    Exceeding damage will be used as shield value, that has to be broken first and
	  cannot be healed. Health and maximum health are taken as set, which allows for
	  the new king to heal himself right after becomming the new king.

  - Overkill Mode

		Exceeding damage will be added on top to the set base maximum health and is fully
		healed, ignoring the set base health. Initial shield can be given to new kings.

	- Strength Mode;
		The total amount of damage will become the new kings maximum health and is fully
		healed. The set maximum health will be used as minimum health value a new king
		gets.

	- Fixed Mode;
		The new king will have fixed set values for health, maximum health, and shield.

# Testing BKB
-------------

There is a build in command that only the caster (channel owner) can use to test out
this Bit King Battle script and test overlay interactions;

  !bkbtest <value>

This will mimic the caster using bits and do either damage if current king is someone else,
or healing if the current king is the caster. Keep in mind due to limitations of this method
the damage or healing is saved, thus remember to set back the actual current king after testing!

# Creating Your Own Overlay
----------------------

It is entirely possible and free to create your own overlay or even adjust the current shipped
overlays to your own needs and style, if you or someone else has knowledge about HTML, CSS and
Javascript. More info can be found in overlay.txt and websocket.txt


# Limitations
-------------

Avatar Uri is not implemented already but the field is available for backwards compatability
