If you are advanced or know someone that can, you can create your
own Bit King Battles overlay using the data send to the websocket.

Read websocket.txt to see what kind of data to expect and you can
always use overlay_default as an example and starting point!

If you want to adjust the default shipped overlays make sure you
make copy of the folder and give it another name so when updating
Bit King Battles it will not override any changes you made!

#  overlay_YOUR_NAMED_OVERLAY_vx.x

This also allows for easy redistribution so other people that use
your created overlay only have to drop into the Bit King Battles
folder and can start using the new overlay straight away!
